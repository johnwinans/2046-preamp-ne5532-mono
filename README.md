If you want to make one of these for yourself you can use this design as
it is or and alter it and make it better.  

From time to time, releases of this project are likely to have boards ready 
to order from OshPark.  (I don't get any money from this.  I just think 
they have a good quality and price.)

See the schematic for Digikey order numbers of the parts.

Here are some images of the board:
